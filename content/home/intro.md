## Our Mission

At Montana Trout Hunters, we love to hunt big fish. But with hunting big fish comes the need for serious skills. Sure, everyone gets lucky once in a while. To catch, fight and land big fish, your skills have to be top-notch. Those fish didn't get that big for no reason! Montana Trout Hunters will help you develop those skills, so when you find that fish of a lifetime at the end our your line, you can successfully land that fish.

### The Splendor of the Big Sky state

Montana Trout Hunters is a full-service fly fishing outfitter, offering float trips on the [Madison](/our-rivers/#madison-river) and [Missouri](/our-rivers/#missouri-river) rivers and walk/wade trips on the [Gallatin](/our-rivers/#gallatin-river) River.

We are not limited to those experiences; let [Darrel](/about/) know how we can plan your next exciting and personalized trip!
