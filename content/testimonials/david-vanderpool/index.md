I’ve had the pleasure of fishing with Darrel DeLeon in Montana many times as a client. I’ve fished with several guides on different waters, and he is one of the best. His passion and professionalism are evident in all aspects of his guiding.

He makes sure your expectations, and he is in line so he can game plan best for you. Whether novice or expert, he is an excellent instructor and educator. You can be confident he’s done his homework regarding water and weather conditions, methods, fly selection and setup, fish location, best approaches, and boat positioning. His boat will be clean, well-equipped, and squared away, so time and opportunities are not lost or missed unnecessarily on boat management. His equipment is always top-notch, from his Adipose drift boat to his guide rods, reels, leaders, tippets, and flies. He doesn’t cut corners, which translates directly to more and better fish and no guide excuses or apologies for the one that got away.

As he guides, you will appreciate his attention to detail, passion as a fellow angler, and genuine appreciation and understanding of the time and money you’ve invested in him and your trip. The only negative about fishing with Darrel is not being able to blame the guide when fish aren’t caught or landed. I always know he’s done his part to put me and our boat in a position to have the best day possible fishing. Beyond the fishing, he is a great person and always good company in the boat regardless of the day’s outcome.
