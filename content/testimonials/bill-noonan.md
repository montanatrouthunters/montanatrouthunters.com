## A Day on the River with Darrel Deleon and Montana Trout Hunters

Fishing with Darrel Deleon as your guide is more than just a float down the river and a decent lunch.  
Sure, Darrel wants his anglers to catch a lot of fish, and they do.

But he also wants his clients to come away from a day on the river with new knowledge and skills they can use to catch more fish back home or wherever their next trip takes them.

Darrel has never taken a cookie-cutter approach to the guiding experience or the guide/client dynamic.

Darrel is gifted at getting on the same wavelength with his anglers. This skill allows him to deliver a well-tailored day of fishing that enables the client to catch a lot of fish while exercising their favorite tactics and skills or stretching those skills and learning some new ones along the way.

Knowledge-sharing and partnership are aspects of “guide service” that Darrel views as essential to a truly successful experience.

Following the example set by his fishing and guiding mentors, he is generous with his knowledge and supportive in his guidance.

Darrel is the kind of teacher you’ve been hoping to find if you are a new or less-experienced angler.

If you are already a skilled and experienced angler, Darrel will fish you hard the way you like to fish.

Or, if you prefer a more hands-off approach, Darrel won’t talk your ear off, he can pull oars with the best, and when he does tell a client what to do, it’s usually to say, “set the hook!”

Darrel’s home waters are the Gallatin and the Missouri, knowing his waters well.

He knows where the fish are at a particular time in a particular season, and on any given day, he knows what they’re doing and what they’re eating.

Some days it even seems like he knows what they’re thinking...

Darrel is a serious professional, well-organized, and squared away on all aspects of providing a safe, productive, and enjoyable day on the river, whether it’s a family outing or a pilgrimage of hard-core trout bums.

All gear and flies, water and soft drinks, snacks, and lunch are provided.

As an outfitter, Darrell can help you plan and organize a trip of any duration, on the water of your choice or his recommendation, and scale-out to accommodate a party of any size by putting together a team of his esteemed colleagues: the best and fishiest guides on the river.

We hope you consider booking your next trip with Darrel Deleon and Montana Trout Hunters.
