I spent several years playing "guide roulette" during my annual trips to central Montana to visit family and fish the Missouri River. Sometimes I won, and sometimes I lost. Since meeting Darrel, I am happy to say that it has been a long, long time since I lost.

There are several things I look for in a guide, and Darrel hits all the marks: He's a hard worker, just as eager as you are to row back up to re-try a good spot. He's passionate about fly fishing and being out on the water, not just secretly rolling his eyes and enduring the guiding he has to do the rest of his life work. He's a great teacher who can help beginners find success and help experienced fishers get better. He's willing to re-tie rigs to try something new and a collector of local knowledge and trends that allow him to get fish to eat even on those days when they seem determined to sulk.

I don't know how many times I've heard other fishermen complain about the bad day they're having, only to have Darrel and I sort of wink at each other, not wanting to brag about all the fish we've been catching. Darrel takes every trip seriously, knowing that it's one of the few chances they might have that year, or ever, to get out and do something incredible for most people.

In addition to all that, Darrel is just a good guy â€“ an other-oriented experience creator who communicates well, puts clients first, and frankly, is responsible for a lot of the soreness in my left arm from what seems like hours spent straining against a deeply bent fly rod.
