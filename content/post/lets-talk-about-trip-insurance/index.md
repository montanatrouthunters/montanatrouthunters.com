March 18, 2020: Bozeman International Airport. Destination Alphonse Island, Seychelles. A Delta Air Lines Boeing 727 pulled away from the gate. I am super-pumped. The plane stopped and began returning to the gate. The pilot's voice came on the intercom, informing us passengers that a 5.7 earthquake had occurred in Salt Lake City, Utah, the first stop in my travels. The airport had been closed with significant damage. Delta agents tried everything to get me to LAX in time for my Emirates flight to Dubai. No luck; my trip was over. But a $175 trip insurance policy saved me from losing $6,200.

Additionally, the airlines, lodges, hotels, outfitter, and guides all got paid as if I made the trip. A positive for everyone involved! On a previous Seychelles trip in 2016, three of ten persons ended up having to use their trip insurance due to extreme weather and an airline strike. Vacations are something we all look forward to. Having a trip canceled for any reason is heartbreaking. The financial benefit of trip insurance helps to ease the pain of a missed trip. Many fishing and hunting trips are years in the making due to cost and availability.

Another example, this time from my perspective as an outfitter: two weeks before four clients arrived for their annual Montana fly fishing trip, the airlines posted a change to their flight itinerary. What should have been a simple three-hour flight from California turned into a required overnight stay in Seattle both ways. This added two days to their trip with the more expense of hotels, meals, and more time off work. They opted to cancel their trip. Montana Trout Hunters' policy for cancellations less than 30 days from the trip start is a 100% loss of deposit. Yet, I value my client relationships and understand that sometimes things are beyond your control. I chose relationship over profit in this case and refunded 100% of the deposit. The guides hired for this trip also waived their right to a cancellation fee—the lodge where they intended to stay refunded their deposit. In total, over $6,000 of income was lost. These particular clients have re-booked for 2021. For a trip insurance policy costing less than $100 per traveler, the lodge, outfitter, and guides would all have been paid the full value of the original trip. Those on the industry side chose the relationship despite the loss of business, but our clients are worth it!

2021 is looking like it will be a record-breaking year for fly fishing trips in Montana. My phone has been blowing up, and my calendar is filling fast. I have hired several guides this year for clients and have had difficulty finding guides who are not already booked. Last year, most outfitters and guides were very forgiving when canceling fees/deposits due to COVID, travel difficulties, and people fearing travel. It was a very lean year for many, and I am uncertain Outfitters, Guides, Fly Shops, and Lodges could survive a second consecutive year of mass cancellations. Trip insurance may seem like an unnecessary added expense to your trip, but it could determine whether your favorite guide or outfitter is in business the following year. Trip insurance is inexpensive. A four-night, three-day guided fishing trip, including airfare from the east coast, would cost a single person about $100 for insurance. Canceling that trip on short notice would cost your guide or outfitter $2,000 of lost income.

Before, when faced with deciding to buy trip insurance, I had only looked at it through the traveler's lens. But after the crazy events of 2020, I aim to present a new perspective that proves trip insurance benefits both the traveler and host. When faced with buying trip insurance, I urge you to consider and appreciate all parties involved. Bottom line, trip insurance is not always needed, but it makes a bad situation better for everyone when things turn sour.
