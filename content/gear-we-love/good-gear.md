There is hardly a guide day that goes buy that doesn’t involve a conversation about gear. As a full time fishing and hunting guide I don’t just use gear I abuse the crap out of it. Gear that doesn’t last simply won’t get a second chance. Gear that survives and lives up to expectations makes our recommendation list.

Taking hundreds of clients a year affords us the opportunity to see and use a lot of different equipment in real world applications and not just a casting pond. It gives an insight on the performance, durability and demands put on gear in fishing applications.
