Tippet is a critical part of any angler's gear, and selecting the right tippet can make all the difference in your fishing success. At Montana Trout Hunters, we've seen many people make big mistakes when it comes to tippet selection, and it can lead to lost flies and missed opportunities.

When it comes to tippet material, some anglers prefer nylon for dry flies and fluorocarbon for nymphs, but at Montana Trout Hunters, we use fluorocarbon for everything. Fluorocarbon tippet has several advantages over nylon, including being less visible in the water and having higher abrasion resistance.

It's important to note that selecting the right tippet size is also crucial. We recommend using 4x fluorocarbon for most situations in Montana, with the exception of Spring Creeks where large, educated trout may be "tippet shy." Some anglers argue that smaller tippets need to be used for dry fly fishing, but if you present the fly properly, you can use 1x tippet if you could get it through the eye of the hook.

It's important to remember that tippet is the weakest point in your leader setup, so it's crucial to inspect it regularly for any signs of wear and tear. It's also important to replace your tippet frequently, especially after catching several fish or if it's been exposed to heavy use.

Selecting the right tippet is crucial for your fishing success. At Montana Trout Hunters, we recommend using fluorocarbon tippet in 4x for most situations in Montana, but it's important to do your research and select the tippet that best meets your needs. By selecting the right tippet and inspecting it regularly, you'll be well on your way to landing more fish on the river.
