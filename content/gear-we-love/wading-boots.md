title: Wading Boots
---

Wading boots are an essential piece of gear for any angler fishing Montana's rivers and streams. But, before you show up for a guided float trip, please do not wear studded boots. Studded boots will absolutely ruin the floor of your guide's boat, and he or she is likely to test your swimming prowess.

When it comes to purchasing wading boots, careful thought should be given to the decision. Several years ago, a war raged against felt boots, claiming they were responsible for the transfer of harmful aquatic species. However, what the industry failed to address was the other textiles within the boot, waders, and socks. In the end, felt made a comeback for one reason: nothing works better.

It's worth noting that Yellowstone National Park does not permit felt boots while fishing in the park. Therefore, anglers fishing in Yellowstone must use non-felt alternatives.

When selecting wading boots, look for boots that are comfortable and durable, with good ankle support and grip on wet, slippery rocks. Rubber soles with a good tread pattern are an excellent alternative to felt, and some anglers prefer them due to their durability and ease of maintenance.

At Montana Trout Hunters, we recommend rubber-soled wading boots with a good tread pattern, but we also encourage our clients to do their research and select the boots that best meet their needs. Ultimately, having the right wading boots will provide the necessary grip and stability to safely navigate Montana's rivers and streams.
