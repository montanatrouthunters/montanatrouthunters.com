title: Waders
---

As a full-time fishing and hunting guide in Montana, few things give me more anxiety than recommending waders to someone. Personally, I hate waders - or at least I used to, until I broke down and bought a pair with a "pee" zipper. Life-changing! Now, I tolerate waders in torrential rainstorms and when temperatures fall below 40 degrees.

If you must wear waders, breathable Gore-Tex waders are by far the most comfortable option. Chest waders with a front zipper are life-changing, but the $1000 price tag is outrageous. As a guide, I have tried and tested many different brands and styles of waders, and my favorite are quick-dry pants and Chaco sandals. At times, I will trade my river sandals for neoprene socks and wading boots.

On a more serious note, if you do wear waders, please wear your wading belt and make sure it is almost uncomfortably tight. The belt will not prevent your waders from filling with water if you take a river bath, but if worn properly, it will buy you a few extra seconds to get back on your feet before you turn into a buoy. Working in this industry exposes us to tragedy on an annual basis and reminds us how unforgiving the river can be for even the slightest mistake.

Waders can be a necessary evil for fishing in Montana's rivers and streams, but there are comfortable and affordable options available. At Montana Trout Hunters, we recommend breathable Gore-Tex waders with a front zipper if you must wear them, but we also encourage our clients to consider quick-dry pants and Chaco sandals as a comfortable alternative. And, as always, remember to wear your wading belt and stay safe on the river.
