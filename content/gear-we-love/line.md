At Montana Trout Hunters, we want to ensure that our customers have the best possible fishing experience. That's why we strongly recommend purchasing a new fly line before your trip, and we believe that Scientific Anglers is the best brand for the job.

While it may seem like a small detail, having the right fly line can make a big difference in your fishing success. Countless times a year, clients spend thousands of dollars on a trip to Montana, but neglect to spend $129 on a new line. The biggest problem we encounter is fly lines sinking, which can make it difficult to achieve a drag-free drift. As you know, presentation is everything in fly fishing, and if your flies are dragging through the water column, the chances of fish eating your fly are significantly diminished.

At Montana Trout Hunters, we primarily use Scientific Anglers Amplitude MPX taper for dry fly fishing and nymphing. We also use Air Flow lines in a variety of weights for streamer fishing. When it comes to streamer fishing, grain weight is more about the size of the streamer you're fishing and less about sink rates.

In conclusion, at Montana Trout Hunters, we believe that having the right fly line is essential to a successful and enjoyable fishing experience. We strongly recommend purchasing a new Scientific Anglers fly line before your trip to ensure that you have the best possible chance of catching Montana's premier trout. With the right fly line and the guidance of our expert guides, you'll be well on your way to an unforgettable fishing adventure.
