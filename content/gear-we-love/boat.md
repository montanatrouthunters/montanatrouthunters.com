Drift boats are an essential tool for fly fishing in Montana, and at Montana Trout Hunters, we rely on them every day to get our clients to some of the best fishing spots in the state. But what exactly is a drift boat, and why are they so important?

A drift boat is a specialized watercraft designed for fly fishing in rivers and streams. It's built to navigate shallow water and rocky terrain while providing a stable and comfortable platform for fishing. Drift boats are typically made of aluminum or fiberglass and range in length from 13 to 20 feet. They're propelled by oars and can be rowed by one or two people, depending on the size of the boat.

One of the biggest advantages of drift boats is their versatility. They're perfect for navigating tight channels and shallow water, which makes them ideal for fly fishing in Montana's rivers and streams. They also provide a stable platform for casting, which is essential when targeting Montana's premier trout. Additionally, drift boats are comfortable and can be outfitted with seats, dry storage, and other amenities to make your fishing trip as enjoyable as possible.

At Montana Trout Hunters, we take pride in our fleet of top-of-the-line drift boats. Our boats are meticulously maintained and equipped with all the necessary safety equipment to ensure a safe and enjoyable trip. We use high-quality oars and anchors to ensure that we can navigate even the toughest river conditions.
