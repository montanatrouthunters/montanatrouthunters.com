At Montana Trout Hunters, we know that preparation is key when it comes to fly fishing in Montana. One of the most common questions we get is about appropriate clothing for our adventures, and we understand that it's not always an easy question to answer. Montana is known for having the world record for the fastest temperature rise, and also for the fastest temperature drop. With such drastic weather changes, it's important to be prepared for anything.

We recommend checking the weather before your trip to get an idea of what to expect. Other than winter, Montana's daily temperatures can range from high to low by roughly 40 degrees. A rain jacket is a must, as we can get a lot of rain in a short amount of time. Even if it's not raining, a light puffy jacket is never a bad idea.

At Montana Trout Hunters, we want to make sure that our customers are comfortable and prepared for anything. We recommend dressing in layers, so you can adjust your clothing as needed throughout the day. This can include a base layer, mid-layer, and outer layer. We also recommend bringing a hat and sunglasses to protect yourself from the sun, as well as comfortable and sturdy footwear that can handle various terrain.

Our seasoned guides understand that appropriate clothing is an essential part of being prepared for a successful and enjoyable fishing experience. We recommend checking the weather, dressing in layers, and bringing a rain jacket and puffy jacket for unexpected weather changes. With the right clothing and the guidance of our expert guides, you'll be well on your way to catching some of Montana's premier trout and having the experience of a lifetime.
