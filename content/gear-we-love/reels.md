After handling hundreds of reels of all makes, models and ages there are two reels that stand out above the rest. Over time most reels donâ€™t operate as smoothly as they did the day they came out of the box. The exceptions are [Lamson](https://www.waterworks-lamson.com/) and [Hatch](https://www.hatchoutdoors.com/). Lamson reels are very affordable, have an exceptional drag system and have a lifetime warranty. Hatch is probably the best reel ever made. From battling salmon and steelhead in Alaska to the world's harshest conditions and hard fighting fish of the Seychelles, the Hatch never fails, and the drag feels as smooth as the day it left the factory.
