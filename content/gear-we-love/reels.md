title: Reels

Whoever coined the phrase “reels are just there to hold your fly line” never fished Montana’s premier rivers. Montana has big angry trout that will put you into your backing.
I handle hundreds of reels of all makes, models, and ages every year.

When purchasing a new reel, I look at four key attributes: durability, performance, price, and customer service. There are many lightweight, aesthetically pleasing reels on the market that I don’t think could survive a single season, much less seven days in Seychelles. I look for an excellent sealed drag system to keep out salt water, smoothness, and low start-up inertia. Startup inertia is significant in the initial run of a powerful fish. All reel companies claim a smooth sealed drag system and low start-up inertia. Most of them do when the reel is new and not under tension. These are complex attributes to determine with a new reel, but these features are more apparent as reels are heavily used. This is when customer service becomes invaluable. If a reel needs to be sent back and it takes more than two weeks to return to you, I consider this a potential problem. I have recommended certain reels because they have passed my extreme scrutiny. As of late, all of my previous recommendations have failed me. When a company charges $700 for a trout/small bonefish reel, you’re damn right. I will expect them to exceed my performance and customer service expectations.
