At Montana Trout Hunters, we know firsthand the importance of having a high-quality reel when you're fly fishing in Montana. Our premier rivers are home to some of the biggest and most powerful trout in the country, and having a reliable reel is essential to landing them.

When it comes to choosing a fly reel, there are several key attributes to consider. Durability, performance, price, and customer service are all important factors that can impact your fishing experience. We understand that there are many lightweight, aesthetically pleasing reels on the market, but we know that not all of them can stand up to the tough conditions of Montana's premier rivers.

We look for reels with an excellent sealed drag system that can keep out salt water and provide smoothness and low start-up inertia. Startup inertia is significant in the initial run of a powerful fish, and having a smooth sealed drag system with low start-up inertia can make all the difference when it comes to landing big trout.

All reel companies claim to have a smooth sealed drag system and low start-up inertia, but it can be difficult to determine these attributes with a new reel. At Montana Trout Hunters, we put our reels to the test by heavily using them in real fishing situations. This is when the features of the reel become more apparent, and it's also when customer service becomes invaluable. If a reel needs to be sent back for repairs, we expect a quick turnaround time to minimize downtime for our customers.

We have recommended certain reels in the past because they have passed our extreme scrutiny, but we know that the best reel for you may depend on your specific needs and experience level. That's why we offer high-quality reels from the best brands in the industry, and our experienced guides can help you choose the right reel for your fishing situation.
