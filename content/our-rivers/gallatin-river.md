title: Gallatin River
date: 2019-07-01

The Gallatin River is one of the most accessible and picturesque streams in all of Montana. Beginning in Yellowstone National Park and winding southward past Big Sky into the Gallatin Valley near Bozeman, eventually arriving in Three Forks to join the Madison and Jefferson Rivers to form the [Missouri River](#missouri-river) River, the Gallatin makes a great run through southwest Montana, and it fishes well from top to bottom.

## Description

The locals call her 'The Gally', and this river may be one of the most accessible streams in all of Montana. From a meandering stream in YNP to a hard-charging mid-sized river in the canyon section to a larger floatable river in the lower portion, the Gallatin has excellent public access all along the way.

## Fish Species

The Gallatin River is home to rainbow trout and brown trout, with some reaching impressive sizes.

## Fishing Seasons and Techniques

The Gallatin is a year-round wade fishery for both local and traveling anglers. You'll find folks out working the water most days in winter, especially in March, as temperatures warm a bit and Big Sky skiers look for a break from the slopes and head out to catch some trout.

April and May offer some decent mayfly and midge hatches, but the Gallatin shows its true colors after run-off has subsided in mid to late June. The salmonfly, golden stone, and yellow sally hatches in June and July can be phenomenal, and there's just nothing like having a fly as long as your ring finger devoured by a trout to get your blood pumping.

Green drakes and pale morning duns will fill out the mayfly hatches for the summer months, along with early morning trico emergences and afternoon caddis flights. After that, it's hoppers, ants, and beetles to get the trout to look skyward, with a nice baetis hatch in Sept and October to round out the season. Tugging streamers in the fall can be very effective, especially below the canyon, where some big brown trout lurk and get feisty as they prepare to spawn.

## Best Areas of the River to Fish

The closer you get to the headwaters of the Missouri river, the larger the fish tend to be and the more open country you'll get to see along the way as you are on the Gallatin Valley floor. In the Gallatin Canyon near Big Sky, you may have to contend with whitewater rafters and kayakers as much as trout, but above and below are generally quiet and allow ample room to find a few nice rainbow and brown trout.

## Best Times of Day to Fish

Early mornings and evenings tend to be the best times to fish the Gallatin River.

## Types of Equipment and Flies to Use

A well-presented generic pattern (stimulators, parachute adams, humpys, royal wulffs) will get you plenty of attention on most days. Matching the hatch can be important during specific hatches, but as a general rule of thumb, it is not as important on a river like the Gallatin.

The Gallatin River is another Montana bucket list water that deserves your attention and serves very well as a leg of a Trout Tour through the greater Yellowstone area and beyond.
