The Missouri River near Craig, Montana is a broad tailwater river and is considered by many to be a true Montana trout fly fishing mecca. The Mo, as the locals call her, is our home water and arguably the most consistent fishery in the Rocky Mountain West and productive wild trout fishery in the lower 48. This river is best described as a gigantic spring creek where the rainbow trout grow fast and strong, the brown trout become husky and cunning, and the backdrops are just as gorgeous as the fish.

## Description

The Missouri River is a large, tailwater river that is known for its excellent fishing opportunities. It is a year-round fishery, but the best fishing typically occurs between March and November, with May through October being the prime time season.

## Fish Species

The Missouri River is home to rainbow trout, brown trout, cutthroat trout, and mountain whitefish.

## Fishing Seasons and Techniques

We cover all the bases in terms of technique on the Missouri, regularly fishing nymphs, streamers, and dry flies. Deep nymphing is definitely the way to keep the action lively and catch more fish, which is especially handy for newer anglers. We also enjoy tugging streamers to trigger the predator response from our larger trout (And sometimes walleye!), but the dry fly fishing is why people travel from around the world to come to the Missouri River.

## Insect Hatches

The Missouri River will amaze you with its aquatic insect hatches, average fish size, and an overall population of big rainbow trout and brown trout. Arguably, the Missouri River has no equal when it comes to consistently sight fishing dry flies for rising trout. The Missouri River is an insect factory, pumping out hatch after hatch throughout the seasons.

Midges and Blue-winged Olives will hatch from late March through May. Caddis will arrive in early May, leave in June and then come back in July and usually stay through the fall. There is rarely a day on the Missouri where we can’t get any trout to eat a caddis, even into late October.

The Pale Morning duns arrive in June and this hatch usually corresponds with the end of run-off. Tricos will appear sometime in mid-July to mid-August, and this hatch is stunning in the millions and millions of bugs it produces – every day.

The terrestrial is usually in full swing by August 1st, with grasshoppers, ants, and beetles getting gobbled up by big-eyed trout up and down the river. The fall Blue-winged Olive and October Caddis hatches round out the season, and usually send us into winter with a last blast. It is a true insect smorgasbord.

## Access and Regulations

The 35-mile section of blue-ribbon Missouri River has lots of public access and excellent wade fishing opportunities, but it is primarily a drift boat river. A boat gives you two very important things on the Missouri: access to water and fish you otherwise wouldn’t be able to reach, and the ability to be put in the best position to catch those trout.

You could spend a lifetime or two learning the secrets and nuances of the Missouri River, and there are lots who’ve tried. It’s that good.
