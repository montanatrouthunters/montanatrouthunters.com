- Trip insurance through Global Rescue â€“ **highly recommended**
  - Global Rescue offers trip insurance plans that provide coverage for trip cancellation, interruption, medical expenses, and emergency evacuation. We highly recommend purchasing a plan to protect yourself from unexpected circumstances that may cause you to cancel or interrupt your trip.
  - Learn more and purchase a plan at [Global Rescue](https://partner.globalrescue.com/montanatrouthunters/index.html)

#### What to Bring

- Appropriate clothing for weather conditions. We try to have spare rain jackets and pants, but bring your own or rent a pair from a local fly shop if waders are necessary.
- Guide gratuities are customary in the fishing guide industry and are greatly appreciated. Tips should reflect the level of service and effort put forth by your guide.
- You are welcome to bring your own alcoholic beverages.

#### Refund and Cancellation Policy

If you need to cancel your trip, please provide 30 or more days' notice. Your deposit will be refunded 100%, less credit card fees (if applicable).

If you provide less than 30 days' notice of intent to cancel, your deposit will be forfeited if the guide assigned cannot be re-booked for the day of cancellation. A 100% refund will be granted if the guide can be rescheduled, minus credit card fees (if applicable).

Trips canceled by the guide alone or by a joint guide/client decision due to weather, health concerns, or other uncontrollable circumstances will result in a full refund if rescheduling is not possible.

{{% callout note %}}
We understand that unforeseen circumstances that lead to canceling a trip do occur, and therefore, we reserve the right to make refund decisions on a case-by-case basis.
